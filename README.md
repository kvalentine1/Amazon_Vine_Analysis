# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to perfom ETL on an Amazon dataset consiting of reviews of products in their Vine program. This program allows companies to provide their product to Amazon customers for free in exchange for a review. The dataset I chose to use was for the beauty products category. The reviews included in this analysis are reviews that had 20 or more helpful/not helpful votes with at least 50% of the votes being helpful votes.


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

Of the reviews analyzed, 647 reviews were from Vine participants and 74,113 votes were from unpaid customers.


Of the Vine program reviews, there were 229 5-star reviews. For unpaid reviews, 43,217 reviews were 5-stars.


35.39% of Vine program reviews were 5-stars while 58.31% of unpaid reviews were 5-stars.




## Summary: 

From the analysis, it does not appear that a customer receiving a product for free in exchange for a review shows a positive bias for giving the product a positive review. Only 35% of Vine reviewers gave products 5 stars while unpaid customers gave 58% of 5-star reviews. 
I performed an additional analysis to determine the totals and percentages of 1-star reviews. The percent of 1-star reviews for Vine program participants was a small 5.72% while unpaid customers 1-star reviews made up 19.57% of unpaid reviews. In the instance of 1-star reviews, it could be assumed that customers given the product for free are much less likely to review it negatively compared to customers who purchased the product.
